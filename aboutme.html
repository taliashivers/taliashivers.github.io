                   <p>Welcome to my page! I am a hard-working, Master's student trying to make my way into the Computer Science world. I have a wide variety of experience and can't wait to show the right company what I can do for them! I am starting a little later in life getting into this field, but sometimes things happen in life, and your goals change. I wasn't sure what I wanted originally and I was lost. Then I found programming, which led me to data analysis, and now I'm here! With you, lucky us:) </p>
                   <p>I am very excited for this new chapter in my life, and hopefully yours too!</p>
                   <p>When I'm not working or practicing my skills in programming, I enjoy the outdoors with my son. I have a camera and really enjoy getting into nature and capturing the momemnt.</p>
